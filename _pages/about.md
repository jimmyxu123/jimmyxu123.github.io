Hi! I am Jiawei Xu. You can also call me Jimmy. I am a first year PhD student in [AMSC](https://amsc.umd.edu/) at University of Maryland, where I focus on how mathematics guide us design and understand machine learning models better. Especially, I am interested in generative modeling with applications in scientific computing; vision, and text generations. 

I graduated with honors in Mathematics from NYU in Spring 2025. While there, I had the fortune to work with Prof. [Eric Vanden-Eijnden](https://wp.nyu.edu/courantinstituteofmathematicalsciences-eve2/) on numerical optimization of generative modeling and with Prof. [Chinmay Hegde](https://chinmayhegde.github.io/) on benchmarking data curations methods.

Besides academics, I love fishing. The biggest fish I've ever caught is a 35-pound grass carp in China.
